Hey, I have added line wise explanation for the code.
This is text editor, which is with regard to a project I was doing with Prof. Debadatta Mishra of CSE dept.
The project intended to create a Integrated development environment, this is implementation of some progress of the project,

To run the application under the folder type the following in terminal
You may also need to install gcc and gtk library.

`sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev`
*and*
`sudo apt-get install gtk+2.0`

Then run the following commands

`sh compile.sh editor`

`./editor`

I used the instructions from the following website, which contains concise resources for understanding and implementing basic glade application.
