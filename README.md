I have practiced a tutorial with linewise code explanations under the BasicImplementation folder, furthermore several programmes with linewise explanation have  been implemented
The source code of C implemenation can be found under src folder.
Template folder contains the basic template files used to open and initialize application with some basic command line arguments

To run the application under text_editor_menu_bar folder type the following in terminal

$ sh compile.sh editor   \n
$ ./editor

I used the instructions from the following website, which contains concise resources for understanding and implementing basic glade application.
